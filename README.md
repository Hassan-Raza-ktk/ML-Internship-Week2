# ML Internship - Week 2: Data Handling with NumPy & Pandas

This repository contains the tasks completed during the second week of my Machine Learning internship.

## Project Structure
- **Task_2_1_Numpy/**: Exercises covering NumPy basics, arrays, and mathematical operations.
- **Task_2_2_Pandas/**: Comprehensive data cleaning and exploration on the Titanic dataset.
- **screenshots/**: Proof of environment setup and code execution.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Key Learning Outcomes
1. Data cleaning techniques (handling missing values, encoding).
2. Efficient array processing using NumPy.
3. Feature engineering and data visualization.
